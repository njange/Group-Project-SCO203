# Group-Project-SCO203
This repository contains a simple login form application implemented in Visual Basic .NET. Below is an overview of the code structure and functionality:

#Project Overview
The project aims to create a login form adhering to certain criteria such as minimum length requirements for username and password, inclusion of digits and special characters in the password, and providing an option to toggle password visibility.

#File Structure
Form1.vb: This file contains the main code for the login form.
Readme.md: This file provides an overview of the project and its components.
#Implementation Details
Login Form: The login form consists of two input fields - one for the username and the other for the password. It also includes a 'Login' button for initiating the login process.
Password Visibility: Users have the option to toggle password visibility using a checkbox labeled 'See Password'.
Validation: The login form implements basic validation checks for the username and password. It verifies if the username is at least 3 characters long and if the password is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one digit, and at least one special character.
Message Boxes: Messages are displayed via message boxes to inform the user about any validation errors or successful login attempts.
#Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
Run the application to launch the login form.
Enter a username and password, and click the 'Login' button to attempt login.
Follow the on-screen instructions in case of any validation errors or successful login.
Testing
Unit Testing: Unit tests are yet to be implemented. Refer to the provided notes for guidance on conducting unit tests.
System Testing: System testing is also pending. It involves testing the application as a whole to ensure all components function correctly together. Conduct your own research to understand and implement system testing effectively.
#Notes
